# Sources, licences and takedowns

The directory and job index are licensed under CC BY 4.0 (see `LICENSE-DATA`). They are built
from the sources below. Only sources whose licence allows it may add a company; the others are
used only to confirm boards that are already listed, and are never published.

## Never redistributed

RawJobs can also read public job boards a user adds: Hacker News "Who is hiring" (through Algolia's
HN API), Remotive, Arbeitnow and Remote OK. Their data is fetched on each user's own computer, shown
with credit to the source and linked back to it, and **never** included in this directory, the index,
the job feed or any release.

## Takedown and opt-out

If you run a company and don't want it listed, or you see something here that shouldn't be:

1. Open a [takedown request](https://github.com/Tanmay-Mhatre/rawjobs/issues/new?template=takedown.yml)
   (or an issue in this repo). Give the company name and its careers page or domain. Don't include
   personal data.
2. We reply within **7 days**. Once confirmed, the company goes into `denylist.json`.
3. The next release (contributions run every 3 hours, full rebuild every Monday) leaves it out of
   the directory and the index, and user contributions can't add it back.

Older releases stay downloadable on GitHub; we don't rewrite history. If something in an older
release is a legal problem, say so in the request and we will remove that release.

The listing only says that a company has a public job board, and what is posted there. Jobs keep
linking to the company's own careers page.
